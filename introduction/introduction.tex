\section{The Case for New Solar Absorber Materials for Photovoltaic Devices}

\subsection{Terawatt-Scale Power Production from Renewable Resources}

It is now widely accepted that the world is heading towards a major energy crisis, where there will come a point that the current major sources of energy (namely fossil fuels) will be unable to meet increasing global demand for energy as they are not a limitless supply. Furthermore, there is the ever present worry of climate change linked to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Renewable, low-carbon alternative energy sources are therefore clearly desirable. From purely environmental considerations, it seems clear that fossil fuels should no longer be used and we should meet our energy needs solely from renewable, low-carbon energy resources such as solar power. However, it is not only environmental sustainability that must be considered, we must also consider the economic feasibility of solar power for large-scale projects. Germany is an example of a country making considerable efforts to increase the percentage of their energy supplied by solar power. On 9 June 2014 Germany even generated over 50\% of its electricity demand from solar for the first time \cite{Germany_guardian_news}. Although on average the country is not able to produce such a large portion from solar power, with solar-generated power providing approximately 7.5\% of net electricity consumption in 2015 \cite{Germany_PV}. To facilitate the growth of the solar power capacity in Germany a number of schemes and financial incentives to encourage investment were introduced, such as feed-in tariffs (FiTs).
The German government first introduced FiTs in their Grid Feed-In Law (the Stromeinspeisegesetz), which came into force in 1991 \cite{Germany_Lang}. FiTs are intended to support new developments in renewable energy supply by providing investor certainty. They set the rate a utility company must pay for renewable generated energy and guarantee the provider of renewable energy a specific rate for a long period of time, typically fifteen to twenty years. As this cost is higher than fossil fuel based electricity, the higher price is then passed on to all customers of the utility company to spread out the higher costs so that buyers of renewable energy do not pay higher prices. In Germany, this has resulted in an increase of 6\% on the average electricity bill for users in a specific region \cite{Germany_Oregon}. The social implications of such a cost increase must also be considered in assessing the viability of a particular power source.\\

  \label{global_energy}
\end{figure}

However if solar power, in combination with proper energy transport, storage and secondary conversion into heat and fuels, could be made to be economically feasible; it is a realistic candidate for replacing fossil fuels as a major supply of global energy. It is by far the largest source of energy available to us, as illustrated in figure \ref{global_energy}, and it is also the most widely geographically distributed \cite{inorg_pv}. The Sun supplies $3 \times 10^{24}$ J of energy to the Earth each year, which is around $10^4$ times more than mankind's current annual energy consumption. 
Assuming a fairly modest module efficiency of 20\%, a system capacity factor of 15\%, an average ground cover ratio of 50\%, and 50\% losses related to storage and secondary conversion, 1.6\% of the Earth’s land area would be required for solar-generated power to meet current world energy needs \cite{newPVrev}. Although this would be a fairly large area, it would not be completely unrealistic. For instance, this area would be less than 5\% of the area used for agriculture worldwide \cite{newPVrev}. The area required could also be reduced further through improvements in the efficiency of PV module and by making use of building-integrated PV (BIPV) innovations, largely made possible by flexible, thin-film second generation PV technologies which are discussed further in section \ref{current_tech}. An example of a BIPV project is shown in figure \ref{BIPV}, where solar panels are not only placed on the roof of a building but can also placed on the windows and outer walls.\\

\end{figure}

Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the installed solar generation capacity, with the global grid-connected PV capacity growing from 1.3 GW in 2000 to 139 GW in 2014 \cite{pathways_129}, with approximately a doubling in the cumulative installed capacity every two years \cite{pathways}. Additionally, creative business models have spurred investment in residential solar systems \cite{MIT}. Great improvements in technology, price and performance have helped to facilitate this growth, but solar energy still only provides a minor fraction of the world's energy. In 2013 solar power only provided 0.87\% of the worlds electricity \cite{pathways_130}. Further advances are required to enable a dramatic increase in the contribution from solar power at socially acceptable costs \cite{MIT}. Ultimately, solar power-generation technologies must become cost-competitive with conventional fossil-fuel based power sources.\\

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/LCOE.png}
    \caption{Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of renewable energy technologies and conventional power plants at locations in Germany in 2013.  Specific investments are taken into account with a minimum and maximum value for each technology. Figure taken from reference \citenum{LCOE}.}
  \label{LCOE}
\end{figure}

Levelized cost of energy, or electricity, (LCOE) is a common way to assess how cost competitive renewable energy sources are with their non-renewable counterparts. LCOE allows for the measurement of the performance of different power generating technologies, which may have unequal lifetimes and differing capacities. It is calculated by summing all costs incurred during the lifetime of the technology and dividing this value by the units of energy produced during the lifetime, with units of energy expressed as dollars per kilowatt hour (\$/kWhr) \cite{LCOE2}. This measure is also used as the key selling point for a number of commercial solar cell manufacturers such as First Solar Inc., who market their product as being able to generate electricity at an average of \$0.63 per Watt as stated in their 2013  Annual Report \cite{first_solar}. Using the LCOE, comparisons of grid competitiveness for renewable energy sources can be made \cite{LCOE2}. Figure \ref{LCOE} shows the LCOE of renewable energy technologies and conventional power plants at locations in Germany in 2013, enabling an assessment of the cost-competitiveness of PV power generation at this location, accounting for, for example, typical solar irradiation at the given locations \cite{LCOE}. As the figure shows, both small-scale and large-scale utility solar power are still not cost competitive with the cheapest non-renewable resources.\\

The electrical power is collected by metal contacts to the front and back of the cell. Excitation of an electron-hole pair across the band gap of the p-type material (bottom).

  \label{PV_schematic}
\end{figure}

A solar cell device converts solar energy directly into electrical energy, where solar energy can be described as either a spectrum of electromagnetic radiation or a flux of photons ???(and electrical energy is a flow of charge carriers able to do work in an external circuit.)??? \cite{spatial_resolved_book} Voltage is generated in a solar cell device by the photovoltaic effect. The terms `solar cell' and `photovoltaic (PV) cell' are therefore often used interchangeably.  

Semiconducting materials are usually utilized in a PV device. A semiconductor is described by its valence and conduction energy
bands i.e. a group of energy levels, which electrons may occupy, and a gap in
between with no available energy levels called the bandgap. In thermal equilibrium
at a 0 K, all the energy levels in the valence band are occupied by electrons
while all energy levels in the conduction band remain unoccupied. Energy level
occupancy at temperais usually described by the Fermi-Dirac distribution [1]. \cite{spatial_resolved_book}

Only photons with energies higher than the bandgap can be absorbed in the
perfectly pure semiconductor by exciting an electron from the valence to the conduction
band, while simultaneously conserving total energy and momentum. Two
types of semiconductors are distinguished with regards to the shape of the valence
and conduction band in the energy–momentum diagram. In a direct semiconductor,
the maximum energy of the valence band and the minimum energy of the conductance
band are located at the same momentum, which is not the case in an indirect
semiconductor. Light absorption in a direct semiconductor occurs when the
photon interacts with only an electron from the valence band. Light absorption
in an indirect semiconductor requires a phonon (i.e. a quantum of thermal energy
with considerable momentum, which is discernible as a crystal lattice vibration)
assisted transition, where a phonon provides or consumes the difference in momentum. \cite{spatial_resolved_book}


When semiconducting materials absorb photons of light with energies of at least their band gap, electrons are excited to higher energy states within the material to 
form an electron-hole pair, as shown in figure \ref{PV_schematic}. The excited electron-hole pair would eventually recombine and relax back 
to the ground state of the material with the emission of a photon of an energy equal to the energy of the 
electronic transition that has just occurred. 
However in a PV device, there is a built-in asymmetry that leads excited charge-carriers away before they can recombine back to the ground state. The extra energy of the excited electron generates a potential difference that drives electrons through a load in the external circuit to 
do electrical work. In the conventional PV effect, as electrons are excited across the band gap of a semiconductor, the band gap of the material sets the upper limit for the maximum voltage that can be generated. In early PV devices, the asymmetric junction was a Schottky barrier between a metal and a 
semiconductor but now more effective p-n junctions are used, which are formed by joining together p-type and n-type semiconductors \cite{Nelson1}. \\

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{figures/IV}
    \caption{The current-voltage (I-V) curve of a solar cell showing the open circuit voltage ($V_{OC}$). Figure taken from reference \citenum{PVeducation}.}
  \label{IV}
\end{figure}

When a cell consisting of a p-n junction is illuminated, a voltage develops across the terminals, i.e. between the p-type and n-type semiconductors. When the terminals of the solar cell are disconnected from any external circuit, or there is an infinite load resistance, this voltage is at a maximum and is called the open circuit voltage ($V_{OC}$) and no current is drawn from the solar cell. Conversely, if the terminals of the solar cell are connected together then there is no voltage as all of the electromotive force is used to extract charge-carriers. The maximum possible current is drawn, which is called the short circuit current ($I_{SC}$). For a solar cell to generate power, there must be both voltage and current generated, therefore when the cell is operating at either $V_{OC}$ or $I_{SC}$ the power output is zero. To generate power, a finite load resistance is added to the circuit so that some current is drawn from the solar cell and a voltage develops across the cell that is between 0 and $V_{OC}$ \cite{Nelson1}. There is a maximum operation point for the power output ($P_{MP}$) of a solar cell in terms of I and V, as shown in figure \ref{IV}. This can be defined in terms of $V_{OC}$ and $I_{SC}$ when used in conjunction with the fill factor (FF), which is a number less than one that describes the squareness of the I-V curve \cite{handbook} shown in figure \ref{IV} and is given by equation \ref{P_MP}. The current and voltage are determined by the load and illumination so the load can be tuned such that maximum power output is achieved, but the value of $V_{OC}$ places a limit on the power output of the cell \cite{Nelson1}.

\begin{equation} \label{P_MP}
P_{MP} = FFV_{OC}I_{SC}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{efficiency}
\eta = \frac{P_{MP}}{P_{in}} = \frac{FFV_{OC}I_{SC}}{P_{in}}
\end{equation}

The power conversion efficiency (PCE), $\eta$, of a solar cell is the ratio of power output from the solar cell to the power input from the Sun. This is shown in equation \ref{efficiency}, where $P_{MP}$ has been taken from equation \ref{P_MP}.
For an efficient solar cell, it is desirable to have a high $I_{SC}$, a high $V_{OC}$ and a FF that is as close to 1 as possible \cite{handbook}. \\

**Move discussion to section on candidate new materials** CZTS solar cells are known to be hampered by low $V_{OC}$ relative to the band gap of the material \cite{SS}. Whereas in ferroelectric PV materials, photovoltages orders of magnitude larger than the band gap have been measured (a phenomena referred to as the anomalous photovoltaic effect), but very low photocurrent output is a big challenge for these devices \cite{FE_PV_rev1}.\\

\subsection{Key Properties for Solar Absorber Materials}\label{PV_properties}

A solar (or photovoltaic) cell is an example of an optoelectronic device in which the solar absorber material of choice must allow for the manipulation of light, electrical current and their interaction. Metals are excellent electrical conductors, but do not allow light to travel inside. Glass and related dielectric materials can accommodate and guide light waves, as in electrical fibres, but are electrical insulators. Semiconductors are in between these two types of material as they can carry both electrical current as well as light waves \cite{mat_prop1}. Furthermore, some semiconductors can be used to transform light into electrical current, which was described in the section above. The two vital processes that must occur in a solar absorber material were also discussed above, which were: the excitation of an electron across the band gap from the valence band into the conduction band in a semiconducting material by a photon and the subsequent collection of the photoexcited charge carriers by an external circuit before the photoexcited electron-hole pair recombine. There are certain optical and electrical properties that are necessary for these processes to occur and then there are also certain properties that indicate how well a material is likely to perform in a solar cell device. In this section the band gap, effective mass, dielectric constant and absorption coefficient of a potential solar absorber material will be discussed.

\begin{figure}[h!]

Figure taken from reference \citenum{newPVrev}.}
  \label{SQ}
\end{figure}

The most obvious necessary requirement for a solar absorber material is for it to be a semiconductor so that it possesses a band gap across which an electron can be excited. The value of this band gap must also be somewhere within the energy range of the solar spectrum shown in figure \ref{solar_spectrum}, so that sunlight can induce the photoexcitation of an electron-hole pair across the band gap. Secondly the material must allow for the transport of charge carriers out of the absorber material and into a collection electrode and external circuit in order to do electrical work. Provided these necessary conditions are met and some sort of spatial asymmetry is present to drive electrons away from their point of promotion, the material should exhibit the photovoltaic effect \cite{Nelson2}. However, how well it will actually peform in a solar cell is determined by more stringent criteria and other material properties. Firstly the actual value of the band gap within the range of the solar spectrum is of importance. It is ideal for the value to be as close as possible to the region of photon energies that make up the majority of the solar spectrum. The optimal range for the band gap under typical radiation conditions is between 1.06 eV and 1.50 eV \cite{CZTS_book}. The upper limit of the power conversion efficiency (of incident photon energy into electrical energy) by a device made from a particular absorber material based on its band gap was first calculated by Shockley and Quiesser in 1961 \cite{SQ_1961}. A plot of theoretical efficiency limit as a function of band gap is shown in figure \ref{SQ}.

However, it is not only the value of the band gap that is of importance. More intricate details of the band structure of the material can also impact on the performance of a solar cell device made from the material. Band theory and band structures will be discussed more in section \ref{band_theory}, but it is worth noting at this point that if the band structure shows a band gap that is direct or indirect can have an impact on the performance of a solar cell made from the material. Figure \ref{Si_and_GaAs} shows the band structures of Si and GaAs, where Si possesses an indirect band gap and GaAs possesses a direct band gap. The excitation of an electron directly from the valence band to the conduction band is called fundamental absorption, as there are several other optical absorption transitions that can occur in a semiconducting material, especially in a defective material, and this point will be discussed more in section \ref{PL_section}. Both the total energy and momentum of all particles involved in the absorption process must be conserved. Photons do possess momentum ($\frac{h}{\lambda}$), however this is very small compared to the range of crystal momenta and so the electron momentum is effectively conserved during photon absorption. For a direct transition, the absorption coefficient of a material for a given photon energy $h \nu$ is proportional to the probability, p$_{12}$, of the transition of an electron from the initial state E$_1$ to the final state E$_2$, the density of electrons in the initial state, $g_{v}(E_1)$, and the density of available final states, $g_{c}(E_2)$. This is then summed over all possible transitions between states where $E_2 - E_1 = h\nu$. Since the electron momentum is conserved during a direct transition, the crystal momentum in the valence band is approximately the same as that of the final state in the conduction band at energy $E_2$ \cite{PV_bands_book}.

However for an indirect band gap semiconductor, such as silicon shown at the top of figure \ref{Si_and_GaAs}, the valence band maximum occurs at a different crystal momentum to that of the conduction band minimum. As discussed earlier, the momentum of a photon is far less than that of crystal momenta. In order to conserve the momentum of an electron during an optical transition across an indirect band gap, momentum must be either provided by the lattice or released to the lattice usually in the form of the particle representation of a lattice vibration, known as a phonon, as indicated in the top right schematic of figure \ref{Si_and_GaAs}. Since both a phonon and an electron are needed to make an indirect transition possible, the absorption coefficient depends not only on the density of states of the electrons, as for a direct transition, but also on the availability of emitted or absorbed phonons with the required momentum. Therefore, the absorption coefficient for an indirect transition compared to a direct transition is typically relatively small. Consequently, light penetrates more deeply into an indirect band gap semiconductor before being absorbed. In order to absorb the same amount of light therefore, the absorber layer of a device made from an indirect band gap semiconductor must therefore typically be thicker \cite{PV_bands_book}. This is undesirable if the particular material contains rare or expensive components and also results in higher demands on material quality as charge carriers must be able to be transported through the absorber material in order to be collected.

\begin{figure}[h!]

The band structure of GaAs and schematic of the absorption process in a direct gap semiconductor. Figures adapted from \citenum{phys_semicond} and \citenum{PV_bands_book}.}
  \label{Si_and_GaAs}
\end{figure}

Another property of importance that can be derived from the band structure of a material is the effective mass. The effective mass is related to the curvature of the band at the top of the valence band (for holes) or at the bottom of the conduction band (for electrons). The effective masses of electrons or holes are the masses they seem to carry for transport properties \cite{dielectric_const1}. For example, in ZnSnO$_3$ the hole effective mass has been calculated to be large, indicating that hole mobility will be poor in this material. Poor mobility will make carrier extraction difficult, which has been linked to the low photocurrents observed in this material \cite{effective_mass1}. Effective masses are calculated by fitting a formula, which will be discussed more in the methodology section \ref{properties_methods}. However, just from a quick inspection of the band structure of a material, a more steeply curved shape to the band extrema indicates a lower effective mass and therefore higher carrier mobility. Figure \ref{heavy_holes} shows a schematic of the band structure of a direct band gap semiconductor that has both heavy- and light-hole bands at the valence band extremum, where the flatter band correponds to the heavy-hole band.
Although certain thin-film technologies, which will be discussed towards the end of section \ref{current_tech}, reduce the amount of absorber material the charge carrier must travel through before being collected. So although carriers must still travel through the material, effective mass could be considered less of a crucial parameter for this technology. Furthermore, the effect of the effective mass on the transport properties could be overshadowed by the effect of defects in a real, non-ideal material. It is the dielectric function of the material that provides more insight in this case, which is discussed below.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Schematic of a the band structure of a photoexcited semiconductor with electrons near the bottom of the conduction band, holes near the top of the valence band, where the particular material has both heavy- and light-hole bands (labelled H.H and L.H in the figure respectively).

  \label{heavy_holes}
\end{figure}

Materials with ionic or covalent bonding, or a mixture of the two, are usually either insulators or intrinsic semiconductors. Due to this type of bonding, electrons are bound to the atomic structure and so are unable to move throughout the material when an electric field is applied as in a metal. However, these materials can be polarized by an applied electric field where electrons are displaced relative to their nuclei by small distances. When an external electric field is applied, the positive and negative charges experience electric forces tending to move them apart in the direction of the external field so that their centres of gravity no longer coincide \cite{dielectric2}. The material is now said to be polarized and an electric displacement field ($\vec{D}$) appears within it. The applied field ($\vec{E}$) and displacement field are linked by the macroscopic dielectric function of the material, $\epsilon_r$, as shown by equation \ref{displacement_field} \cite{dielectric_const1}, which is a function of the frequency of the applied field.
\begin{equation} \label{displacement_field}
\vec{D} = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r \vec{E}
\end{equation}
The dielectric function indicates the ability of a material to screen the external electric field by the apparition of a polarization. In a solid, this polarization comes from the re-organization of the electronic density or from the motion the ions that make up the material. These two mechanisms are illustrated in figure \ref{dielectric}a and associated frequencies of the applied field to induce particular polarization responses are shown in figure \ref{dielectric}b. The contribution to the dielectric function from the electronic density, sometimes referred to as the high-frequency dielectric function, is denoted as $\epsilon_{\infty}$ and the contribution of ionic motions is denoted $\epsilon_{vib}$ in equation \ref{dielectric_const} \cite{dielectric_const1}, and is sometimes referred to as the static or low-frequency dielectric function.
\begin{equation} \label{dielectric_const}
\epsilon_{r} = \epsilon_{\infty} + \epsilon_{vib}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/dielectric.png}
    \caption{Polarization mechanisms in a crystalline solid: response of electronic density and motion of ions (a), figure taken from \citenum{newnham}.

  \label{dielectric}
\end{figure}

The value measured for the dielectric function for various frequencies of the applied electric field can give information about different dielectric responses of the material, some of which were shown in figure \ref{dielectric}. Furthermore, the dielectric function is usually a complex quantity, where the imaginary part corresponds to a phase shift of the polarization relative to the applied electric field and leads to the attenuation, i.e. a gradual loss in the intensity, of electromagnetic waves as they pass through the material. The dielectric function is an important material property for a photovoltaic material for a number of reasons. Firstly, it can be shown that the absorption of a material, which has been discussed already as a way of comparing the performance of materials with direct and indirect band gaps in a solar cell, is mainly determined by the imaginary component of the dielectric function \cite{dielectric_func_book1}. The band gap determines the minimum energies photons must have in order to be absorbed by a material, but it does not predict how strongly that material will absorb them. 
In fact, it has even been suggested that when screening for candidate solar absorber materials, a direct band gap within the optimal range for the solar spectrum is not a sufficient criteria as this does not guarantee that the onset of absorption near the band gap is strong \cite{SLME}. In this particular work, instead of the Shockley-Quiesser limit mentioned earlier, they recommend an alternative screening metric, the Spectroscopic Limited Maximum Efficiency (SLME), which depends explicitly on the calculated absorption spectrum of the material.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/absorption_fig2.png}
    \caption{A comparison of the absorption coefficients of the indirect band gap semiconductor Si and the direct band gap semiconductor GaAs across a range of incident photon energies. Figure taken from reference \citenum{PV_bands_book}.}
  \label{absorption_fig2}
\end{figure}

The optical absorption coefficient of a material, $\alpha$, determines the penetration depth, $\frac{1}{\alpha}$, of light incident on the material \cite{absorption_coeff_book1}. Figure \ref{absorption_fig2} shows the absorption coefficients of different semiconductors across a range of wavelengths. The figure shows a less steep onset of absorption for silicon, which as discussed earlier possesses an indirect band gap, compared to that of for example GaAs when the absorption corresponds to a direct band-to-band transition. The implication of the differing absorption coefficients and therefore different optical penetration depths of materials for solar devices is that materials which are stronger absorbers require less material to absorb the light. This forms the basis of thin-film solar cell technologies, for which the impact of defects in the absorber layer material are typically less significant as charge carriers do not have to travel through as much of the absorber material in order to reach a collection electrode. Different solar cell technologies will be discussed further in section \ref{current_tech}.

Secondly, the electrostatic force between an electron-hole pair is reduced when the static (or low-frequency) $\epsilon_r$ is larger \cite{dielectric_const1} due to the enhanced screening of the charge. This, therefore, will reduce the recombination of electron-hole pairs in a material. Another aspect of this property important for photovoltaic materials is that it can improve the defect tolerance of the material. In the majority of cases producing perfectly defect-free materials is impractical, if not impossible. The impact of defects in a material on photovoltaic performance will be discussed more in section \ref{defects_in_PV}, but for now it is just worth noting that defects can trap charge carriers, enhance electron-hole recombination (reducing carrier lifetimes in the material) and therefore have the overall effect of reducing charge collection from a PV device, thereby decreasing the efficiency of the conversion of incident photons into electrical current.
In reference to modelling electronic transport in a material in the presence of defects, $\epsilon_r$ has been referred to as the most important property of the material \cite{defect_tolerance}. A higher dielectric function indicates a greater ability to screen charge. The capture cross-section for charge carriers by a charged defect will therefore be influenced by the value of $\epsilon_r$ of the material \cite{defect_tolerance}. This property can therefore indicate how well photo-excited charge carriers will be transported through a defective photovoltaic material, towards an electrode for carrier collection and on to do electrical work.


\subsection{Current Commercial Solar Cell Technologies \& Limitations}\label{current_tech}
It was first observed in 1839 by Edmond Becquerel that sunlight could be used to generate electricity. Becquerel discovered that if  silver chloride was placed in an acidic solution, connected to platinum electrodes and exposed to sunlight, an electric current flowed. However the effect was small and poorly understood before Albert Einstein's discovery of the photoelectric effect and explanation of the phenomena by the quantum nature of light in 1904 \cite{PV_history1}. Even then, it was not until the development of semiconductor technology during the silicon revolution of the 1950's that solar cells were fabricated which were able to generate significant amounts of electricity. The first silicon solar cell was created in 1954 in the Bell Laboratories with cells achieving efficiencies of 6\%. 
Originally solar cells were developed for terrestrial energy generation, such as the 108 solar cells used to supply energy to the Vanguard satellite in 1958 \cite{PV_history1}. The first oil crisis in 1973 however highlighted the dependency of many economies on fossil fuels and the need to address the security of energy supply,  in particular for Japan and West Germany which had few of their own resources. As a consequence, solar cell research was no longer limited to only high-cost crystalline silicon devices for terrestrial applications, but also into creating cheaper, commercial, thin-film solar cell technologies using absorber materials such as amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride and copper indium diselenide  \cite{PV_history2}.\\

    \caption{Average cost of solar panels composed of a crystalline silicon absorber layer. Figure taken from reference \citenum{PV_chart}.}
  \label{Si_cost}
\end{figure}

In spite of this, crystalline silicon is still the dominant solar cell technology with mono- and poly-crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells comprising up to 90\% of all the solar cells produced in 2008  \cite{Si_rev}. Silicon is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust \cite{Si_abundance}, making it a plausible material to use in large-scale solar power generation. Over 60 years of development have seen device efficiencies increase from 6\% to 25\% for the highest quality research devices and 15-18\% for the more common industrial cells \cite{Si_rev}. As can be seen from figure \ref{SQ}, the best performing silicon devices are now very close to achieving conversion efficiencies close to their theoretical limit, as predicted by Shockley-Quiesser \cite{SQ_1961}. More dramatic however is the fall in manufacturing costs which have halved since 2008 and are more than a hundred times lower than they were in 1977, as shown in figure \ref{Si_cost}. This development was largely aided by progress in semiconductor technology driven by the silicon chip industry, with the solar industry benefiting from advances in silicon manufacturing processes and even making use of waste silicon produced that was not of a high enough grade for silicon chips \cite{PV_history1}. Although the development of silicon-based technologies has clearly revolutionized the modern computer, the optical properties of silicon do not make it ideal for use as a solar absorber material in a photovoltaic device and despite the dramatic reduction in manufacturing costs, the technology is still not able to be cost-competitive with fossil-fuel power generation, as was shown in figure \ref{LCOE}.\\

The primary issue with silicon is that its band gap of 1.1 eV is indirect. The key consequence of this property is that silicon is therefore not a very strong absorber of sunlight (compared to for instance newer, thin-film technologies which are discussed later), resulting in a low optical absorption coefficient  compared to these newer technologies where both band gap and absorption coefficient were two of the key material properties for solar cells discussed in section \ref{PV_properties}. To absorb the same amount of sunlight with a silicon solar cell requires a thicker layer of the material than in thin-film technologies. Photovoltaic devices are very sensitive to defects and impurities. This point is discussed further in section \ref{defects_in_PV}, but the consequence for a thick layer of silicon is that very high quality, non-defective material is necessary to enable charge carrier collection before recombination occurs, which results in high manufacturing costs. The devices are made from flat sheets of crystalline or multicrystalline silicon called wafers that consist of very high quality silicon (99.999999\% pure) 
\cite{sus_book_5}.
The production processes of silicon wafers have been thoroughly optimised, but are still very energy-intensive, time-consuming and complex \cite{emerging_pv} and this is reflected by the position of this type of technology on the plot of efficiency versus cost shown in figure \ref{PV_generations}. Despite decades of development, commercialized silicon solar panels are still too expensive to compete with fossil-fuel based power sources \cite{FE_PV_rev1_5}. \\

The `holy grail' of research into new materials for photovoltaic devices would be to find materials that are strong absorbers of sunlight that could also be produced cost-effectively from materials that are abundant enough for large-scale fabrication of the devices. Then it could be possible for solar energy generation to be economically viable on a large enough scale to replace fossil fuels to meet global energy needs. Such a drive has resulted in the development of what are considered three generations of solar energy technology. These are shown in figure \ref{PV_generations}, where highly efficient crystalline silicon devices with high associated manufacturing costs are considered the first generation of solar cell technology.
Thin-film solar cell devices are typically referred to as second-generation technology. These devices make use of materials that are much more optically thick than silicon (i.e. stronger absorbers of sunlight with higher optical absorption coefficients), which require less material to absorb the same amount of sunlight. Figure \ref{thin_films} shows a comparison between the thickness of the aborber layer in some commercial second-generation PV devices to that of first-generation silicon wafers. The consequence of the reduction in the thickness of the absorber layer is that it is then less important for the material to be of as high-quality as in crystalline silicon devices, which enables the use of low-cost and low-energy fabrication methods \cite{emerging_pv}. 
In the case of thin-film CuInSe$_2$ devices, it has even been found that the `lower quality' poly-crystalline material has a higher performance than its single crystal counterpart \cite{CIS1_3, CIS1_4}. Theoretical studies of the electronic properties of the grain boundaries in CuInSe$_2$ have provided an explanation for this unusual observation based on beneficial band offsets at the grain boundaries \cite{CIS1, CIS2}. This effect is a special case for this particular material, but it embodies the general ideology of thin-film technology well - namely to produce materials able to convert sunlight into electricity as efficiently as possible with the simplest synthesis techniques possible.
However typically the efficiencies of second-generation solar cells are less than that of the best performing first-generation devices. Examples of commercial thin-film technologies include CIGS (Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)$_2$) and CdTe and figure \ref{SQ} shows that the best performing Si devices have higher efficiencies, which are also much closer to their theoretical limit, than these second-generation, thin-film technologies.
Third-generation PV technology aims to make use of the low cost fabrication techniques of the second-generation devices but use multiple energy threshold devices to overcome the Shockley-Quiesser limit for a single band gap solar cell, such as in tandem solar cells where semiconductor p-n junctions of increasing band gap are placed on top of each other in order to capture more of the solar spectrum. Typically the more complicated device architecture of third-generation devices result in higher fabrication costs. Research efforts are therefore largely focused on reducing the fabrication cost of multi-junction devices \cite{3rd_gen}.\\

Current mainstream solar cell technologies, such as first-generation Si wafers and second-generation thin-film CdTe and CIGS solar cells, would not be able to provide solar electricity at the terawatt scale due to the scarcity of Te and In and the relatively long energy payback time for crystalline Si due to the cost and energy intensive fabrication of Si wafers \cite{CZTS_vs_MAPI}. 
Models have even quantified such statements with a predicted In-constrained growth potential of power generation from CIGS PV technology of ~20 GW per year in 2020 due to competing applications of In, such as in liquid crystal displays \cite{culprit_5_3}.
In order to significantly increase the contribution of solar power to global power consumption, it is therefore necessary to develop more economically viable earth-abundant materials for sustainable PV electricity generation. Furthermore, there must be considerable technological breakthroughs that would enable low-cost manufacturing of highly efficient devices with enough of a cost benefit to outweigh the initial cost outlay in optimizing the manufacturing process of the whole device as has been done for silicon over the past 60 years. For this purpose, there is a drive for solar absorber materials with more optimal properties, such as a direct and sunlight matched band gap (as in thin-film technologies such as CdTe and CIGS), but also for materials that are composed of only earth-abundant components. 


\section{The Role of Computational Modelling in Material Design}
The discovery of new functional materials by experimental methods is largely hindered by high costs and time-consuming synthesis procedures \cite{high_tp}.
However, with the rapid increase in computational processing power and the availability of large-scale supercomputers, we are entering a very exciting era in computational materials design. 
There are two main contributions that computational simulations could make towards the technological breakthroughs needed for the development of photovoltaic devices for economically-viable, large-scale solar energy generation. Firstly by predicting properties and screening for certain desirable properties for a solar absorber material, such as an optimal band gap and high carrier mobility, materials simulations are able to aid in the discovery of new materials for use in photovoltaic devices. Secondly, material simulations are able to provide valuable insight to improve understanding of known photovoltaic materials to enable the synthesis of better performing devices. So far in this study we have aimed to make both of these contributions to the field. Firstly, we perform simulations to understand the performance bottlenecks in the candidate earth-abundant, non-toxic solar absorber material \CZTS (CZTS) and we also study the optical properties of three candidate photovoltaic materials which have so far received little attention as solar materials but could provide another possible route for high-performance photovoltaic devices for cost-effective solar energy generation.
