\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.3}{\ignorespaces Schematic of a typical crystalline silicon solar cell device (top), where the majority of the cell consists of a thick p-type base in which most of the light is absorbed. After light absorption, the minority carriers (electrons) diffuse to the junction where they are swept across by the strong built-in electric field. The electrical power is collected by metal contacts to the front and back of the cell. Excitation of an electron-hole pair across the band gap of the p-type material (bottom).
