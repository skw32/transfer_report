@article{SS,
abstract = {Kesterite materials (Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4) are made from non-toxic, earth-abundant and low-cost raw materials. We summarise here the structural and electronic material data relevant for the solar cells. The equilibrium structure of both Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 is the kesterite structure. However, the stannite structure has only a slightly lower binding energy. Because the band gap of the stannite is predicted to be about 100?meV lower than the kesterite band gap, any admixture of stannite will hurt the solar cells. The band gaps of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 are 1.5 and 1.0?eV, respectively. Hardly any experiments on defects are available. Theoretically, the CuZn antisite acceptor is predicted as the most probable defect. The existence region of the kesterite phase is smaller compared with that of chalcopyrites. This makes secondary phases a serious challenge in the development of solar cells. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We examined the 4 K photoluminescence spectra of over a dozen Cu 2ZnSnS4 films and eight devices. We show that samples deficient in zinc show on average a higher quasi donor-acceptor pair (QDAP) density. However, the QDAP density in samples with the same metal composition also varies widely. Devices prepared with similar metal compositions show different open-circuit voltages and fill factors. These metrics are correlated with the concentration of QDAPs in the absorbers. One additional device with insufficient zinc showed the empirically observed low-efficiency expected for this composition. This sample also showed the highest quasi donor-acceptor pair density of all the devices measured.},

@article{Gokmen,
abstract = {We demonstrate that a fundamental performance bottleneck for hydrazine processed kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells with efficiencies reaching above 11{\%} can be the formation of band-edge tail states, which quantum efficiency and photoluminescence data indicate is roughly twice as severe as in higher-performing Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 devices. Low temperature time-resolved photoluminescence data suggest that the enhanced tailing arises primarily from electrostatic potential fluctuations induced by strong compensation and facilitated by a lower CZTSSe dielectric constant. We discuss the implications of the band tails for the voltage deficit in these devices.},

@article{Halliday,
abstract = {The growth of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) polycrystals from solid state reaction over a range of compositions, including the regions which produce the highest efficiency photovoltaic devices, is reported. X-ray measurements confirm the growth of crystalline CZTS. Temperature and intensity dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements show an increase in the energy of the main CZTS luminescence peak with both increasing laser power and increasing temperature. Analysis of the PL peak positions and intensity behavior demonstrates that the results are consistent with the model of fluctuating potentials. This confirms that the polycrystals are heavily doped with the presence of a large concentration of intrinsic defects. The behavior of the main luminescence feature is shown to be qualitatively similar over a broad range of compositions although the nature and amount of secondary phases vary significantly. The implications for thin-film photovoltaic devices are discussed},

@article{Hones,
abstract = {Cu2SnZnS4 is a promising candidate for thin film solar cells with absorbers made of non-toxic and abundant elements. So far very little effort has been put into understanding the basic material properties. We investigate vapour phase grown Cu2SnZnS4 crystals by temperature and intensity dependent photoluminescence measurements. We observe for the first time narrow photoluminescence peaks, which allow us to determine defect levels and to propose a defect recombination model for Cu2SnZnS4. Assuming an exciton binding energy of 10 meV, we find an energy gap of 1.519 eV at 10 K. From the observed DA transitions we derive the energies of two shallow acceptor states 10Â±5 and 30Â±5 meV above the valence band and one shallow donor state 5Â±3 meV below the conduction band.

abstract = {The influence of composition on the quaternary Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) absorber material on the secondary phase content, recombination characteristics and solar cell performance is investigated. Best solar efficiencies are found in a very narrow Cu-poor, Zn-rich composition range. Photoluminescence measurements performed at 12 K indicate strong compensation for Cu-poor composition, similar to what is observed in chalcopyrite-type compounds. We find that strongly copper-deficient CZTS contains significant amounts of ZnS, which degrades the solar cell performance. },
