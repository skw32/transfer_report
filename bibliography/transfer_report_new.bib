@article{SandS,
abstract = {Kesterite materials (Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4) are made from non-toxic, earth-abundant and low-cost raw materials. We summarise here the structural and electronic material data relevant for the solar cells. The equilibrium structure of both Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 is the kesterite structure. However, the stannite structure has only a slightly lower binding energy. Because the band gap of the stannite is predicted to be about 100?meV lower than the kesterite band gap, any admixture of stannite will hurt the solar cells. The band gaps of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 are 1.5 and 1.0?eV, respectively. Hardly any experiments on defects are available. Theoretically, the CuZn antisite acceptor is predicted as the most probable defect. The existence region of the kesterite phase is smaller compared with that of chalcopyrites. This makes secondary phases a serious challenge in the development of solar cells. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

While cadmium telluride and copper{\textendash}indium{\textendash}gallium{\textendash}sulfide{\textendash}selenide (CIGSSe) solar cells have either already surpassed (for CdTe) or reached (for CIGSSe) the 1 GW yr-1 production level, highlighting the promise of these rapidly growing thin-film technologies, reliance on the heavy metal cadmium and scarce elements indium and tellurium has prompted concern about scalability towards the terawatt level. Despite recent advances in structurally related copper{\textendash}zinc{\textendash}tin{\textendash}sulfide{\textendash}selenide (CZTSSe) absorbers, in which indium from CIGSSe is replaced with more plentiful and lower cost zinc and tin, there is still a sizeable performance gap between the kesterite CZTSSe and the more mature CdTe and CIGSSe technologies. This review will discuss recent progress in the CZTSSe field, especially focusing on a direct comparison with analogous higher performing CIGSSe to probe the performance bottlenecks in Earth-abundant kesterite devices. Key limitations in the current generation of CZTSSe devices include a shortfall in open circuit voltage relative to the absorber band gap and secondarily a high series resistance, which contributes to a lower device fill factor. Understanding and addressing these performance issues should yield closer performance parity between CZTSSe and CdTe/CIGSSe absorbers and hopefully facilitate a successful launch of commercialization for the kesterite-based technology.

abstract  ="The need for large scale low carbon solar electricity production has become increasingly urgent for reasons of energy security and climate change mitigation. Third-generation solar cells (SCs) are solution processed SCs based on semiconducting organic macromolecules{,} inorganic nanoparticles or hybrids. This review considers and compares three types of promising 3rd-generation SCs: polymer:fullerene{,} hybrid polymer and perovskite SCs. The review considers work reported since an earlier review (Saunders et al.{,} Adv. Colloid Interface Sci.{,} 2008{,} 138{,} 1) and highlights the great progress that has been made in each area. We consider the operation principles for each SC type and also review the state-of-the-art devices. The polymer:fullerene and hybrid polymer SC open circuit voltages are compared to values predicted from the well-known Scharber equation and similarities and differences discussed. The perovskite SCs are also considered and their remarkable rate of power conversion efficiency performance increase is discussed. The review considers the requirements for large-scale deployment in the contexts of semiconducting polymer and hole transport matrix synthesis and materials selection. It is concluded that the 3rd-generation SC technologies discussed here are well placed for major contribution to large scale energy production. (This has already been partially demonstrated for polymer:fullerene SCs.) Looking further ahead we propose that several of the 3rd-generation SCs considered here have excellent potential to provide the low cost large-scale deployment needed to meet the terawatt challenge for solar electricity generation."}

abstract = "Third-generation approaches to photovoltaics (PVs) aim to achieve high-efficiency devices but still use thin-film, second-generation deposition methods. The concept is to do this with only a small increase in areal costs and hence reduce the cost per Watt peak1 (this metric is the most widely used in the \{PV\} industry). Also, in common with Si-based, second-generation, thin-film technologies, these will use materials that are both nontoxic and not limited in abundance. Thus, these third-generation technologies will be compatible with large-scale implementation of PVs. The approach differs from first-generation fabrication of high-quality, low-defect, single-crystal \{PV\} devices that have high efficiencies approaching the limiting efficiencies for single-bandgap devices but use energy- and time-intensive techniques.

The density-of-states, the complex dielectric function ε(ω)&#xa0;=&#xa0;ε1(ω)&#xa0;+&#xa0;iε2(ω), and the optical absorption coefficient α(ω) are determined, providing fundamental understanding of these materials. We find that even though the \{PBE\} method generates fairly accurate effective crystal potentials, the \{HSE\} and \{GW\} methods improve considerably the band-gap energies Eg and also the localization of the semicore states, thereby describing the optical properties much better. Furthermore, we also present optimized convergence parameters for the self-consistent \{HSE\} calculation in order to reduce the computational time of this orbital-dependent method. "

The Cu/(Zn+Sn) ratio of the thin film sputtered at 75&#xa0;W was close to the stoichiometry of Cu2ZnSnS4. However, the S/(Cu+Zn+Sn) ratio was less than the stoichiometry. The as-deposited films were amorphous and annealed in the atmosphere of Ar+S2 (g). The annealed (1&#xa0;1&#xa0;2), (2&#xa0;0&#xa0;0), (2&#xa0;2&#xa0;0), (3&#xa0;1&#xa0;2) planes were conformed to all the reflection of a kesterite structure. A preferred (1&#xa0;1&#xa0;2) orientation was observed with the increase of the annealing temperature. The optical absorption coefficient of the thin film was about 1.0×104&#xa0;cm−1. The optical band energy was derived to be 1.51&#xa0;eV. The optical absorption coefficient of the sputtered Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films was less than that of CuInS2 thin film, however, the band gap energy was more appropriate for photovoltaic materials. "

abstract = {TiO2 doped with Cu2+ initiates the formation of brookite phase along with anatase. Doping of Cu2+ introduces structural defects into TiO2. The direct evidence is the low intense and broad diffraction peaks. Raman peaks of doped TiO2 are also broad and are blueshifted. Pure TiO2 exhibits an absorption in the UV region, the position of which is shifted towards the visible region on incorporation of Cu into it. The visible absorption peaks arise due to the d-d transition of Cu2+ in the crystalline environment of TiO2. Incorporation of Cu2+ distorts the local structure of TiO2, resulting in the loss of octahedral symmetry surrounding Cu2+. The Jahn-Teller distortion splits the 2
					E
					g and 2
					T
					2g state of Cu2+ into several d states. Interaction of light excites the electron from ground to several of the excited states and gives the visible absorption peaks in the framework of TiO2. These Cu2+
					d states and oxygen defects create band states, thereby favoring electronic transition to these levels and resulting in lowering of band gap of TiO2. A direct confirmation is the increase in the magnitude of Urbach energy with the reduction in the band gap of doped TiO2.},

@article{defects,
abstract = {Point defects and impurities strongly affect the physical properties of materials and have a decisive impact on their performance in applications. First-principles calculations have emerged as a powerful approach that complements experiments and can serve as a predictive tool in the identification and characterization of defects. The theoretical modeling of point defects in crystalline materials by means of electronic-structure calculations, with an emphasis on approaches based on density functional theory (DFT), is reviewed. A general thermodynamic formalism is laid down to investigate the physical properties of point defects independent of the materials class (semiconductors, insulators, and metals), indicating how the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as formation energy, entropy, and excess volume, can be obtained from electronic structure calculations. Practical aspects such as the supercell approach and efficient strategies to extrapolate to the isolated-defect or dilute limit are discussed. Recent advances in tractable approximations to the exchange-correlation functional (DFT þ U, hybrid functionals) and approaches beyond DFT are highlighted. These advances have largely removed the long-standing uncertainty of defect formation energies in semiconductors and insulators due to the failure of standard DFT to reproduce band gaps. Two case studies illustrate how such calculations provide new insight into the physics and role of point defects in real materials.},

We also discuss the research that remains to be done at the exact-exchange level, and present our "dreams of a final theory". "Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran.

@article{defects_new,
abstract = {The quaternary Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is a promising material for the thin-film solar cell applications. However, because CZTS is only stabilized in a very small chemical-potential region and the defect formation is much more complicated compared to the ternary systems, it requires careful control of the thin-film solar cell preparation. We have performed a density-functional theory investigation on the intrinsic defects, defect complexes and Na doping in this complicated system. Our calculations show that the disorder and nonstoichiometry in the Cu–Zn plane induces a bandgap shrinkage of the material. From our calculated results for various defects and the doping rules, we rationalize why the experiments obtain high conversion efficiencies for the thin-film solar cells under the Cu-poor and Zn-rich conditions. The most possible defects which fulfill the experimental Cu-poor and Zn-rich conditions are VCu, rather than ZnCu. It is necessary to keep the Sn chemical potential moderate during the CZTS thin-film solar cell growth because the Sn-involved defects and defect complexes are generally harmful. We also find that Na doping is expected to increase the conductivity and improves the conversion efficiency of CZTS solar cells. The present study provides valuable insights into the defect physics of the complicated CZTS system and a theoretical basis for exploring its practical applications as thin-film solar cell absorbers.},

We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called \{VAMP\} (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.

abstract = {Hybrid density functionals are very successful in describing a wide range of molecular properties accurately. In large molecules and solids, however, calculating the exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange is computationally expensive, especially for systems with metallic characteristics. In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree-Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.

Both compounds were found to crystallize in the kesterite type structure, but with a disorder within the Cu–Zn layers at z=1/4 and 3/4. The latter causes CuZn and ZnCu anti-site defects, whose concentration depends on the sample growth conditions. The temperature dependent structural phase transition in \{CZTS\} was studied by in-situ high temperature diffraction experiments using high energy synchrotron X-rays. The transition from the tetragonal kesterite to the cubic sphalerite type structure is discussed by means of the interplay of increasing and decreasing cation–anion–cation bond angles in the coordination tetrahedra, reflected by the shift of the anion atomic coordinates to more ideal (x and y) or non-ideal (z) values. This striking behavior may be connected with frustrations that occur due to the triangular geometry of the coordination tetrahedra. "

In this work, we complement earlier published theoretical studies by investigating the change in the Cu2ZnSnS4 band gap energy induced by the dominating isovalent (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;CuZn) and (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;VCu) defect complexes and the corresponding larger [(ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;CuZn)&#xa0;+&#xa0;(ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;VCu)] complex. The study is based on the generalized gradient approximation with corrections for on-site Coulomb interactions (GGA&#xa0;+&#xa0;U) and the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerh hybrid functional method (HSE06) within the first-principles density functional theory. We find that (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;CuZn) and (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;VCu) affect the band gap energies in an opposite way: (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;CuZn) decreases the gap whereas (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;VCu) increases the gap. However, there is a strong correlation between these two defect complexes. The presence of the Cu-poor (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;VCu) defect complex lowers the formation energy of the antisite (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;CuZn) defect complex in close configuration, and vice versa. Thereby, and considering the opposite effect on the band gap for (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;CuZn) and (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;VCu), our results indicate that the band gap energy will be compensated and stabilized in Cu-poor Cu2ZnSnS4. We discuss the underlying mechanisms behind the band gap physics of the considered isovalent defect complexes. "

@article{FE_PV_rev1,
abstract = {The ferroelectric-photovoltaic (FE-PV) device, in which a homogeneous ferroelectric material is used as a light absorbing layer, has been investigated during the past several decades with numerous ferroelectric oxides. The FE-PV effect is distinctly different from the typical photovoltaic (PV) effect in semiconductor p–n junctions in that the polarization electric field is the driving force for the photocurrent in FE-PV devices. In addition, the anomalous photovoltaic effect, in which the voltage output along the polarization direction can be significantly larger than the bandgap of the ferroelectric materials, has been frequently observed in FE-PV devices. However, a big challenge faced by the FE-PV devices is the very low photocurrent output. The research interest in FE-PV devices has been re-spurred by the recent discovery of above-bandgap photovoltage in materials with ferroelectric domain walls, electric switchable diodes and photovoltaic effects, tip-enhanced photovoltaic effects at the nanoscale, and new low-bandgap ferroelectric materials and device design. In this feature article, we reviewed the advance in understanding the mechanisms of the ferroelectric photovoltaic effects and recent progress in improving the photovoltaic device performance, including the emerging approaches of integrating the ferroelectric materials into organic heterojunction photovoltaic devices for very high efficiency PV devices.},

Although the main materials currently used or investigated and the associated fabrication technologies are individually described, emphasis is on silicon-based solar cells. Wafer-based crystalline silicon solar modules dominate in terms of production, but amorphous silicon solar cells have the potential to undercut costs owing, for example, to the roll-to-roll production possibilities for modules. Recent developments suggest that thin-film crystalline silicon (especially microcrystalline silicon) is becoming a prime candidate for future photovoltaics.},

abstract = {Kesterite materials (Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4) are made from non-toxic, earth-abundant and low-cost raw materials. We summarise here the structural and electronic material data relevant for the solar cells. The equilibrium structure of both Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 is the kesterite structure. However, the stannite structure has only a slightly lower binding energy. Because the band gap of the stannite is predicted to be about 100?meV lower than the kesterite band gap, any admixture of stannite will hurt the solar cells. The band gaps of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 are 1.5 and 1.0?eV, respectively. Hardly any experiments on defects are available. Theoretically, the CuZn antisite acceptor is predicted as the most probable defect. The existence region of the kesterite phase is smaller compared with that of chalcopyrites. This makes secondary phases a serious challenge in the development of solar cells. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The density-of-states, the complex dielectric function ε(ω)&#xa0;=&#xa0;ε1(ω)&#xa0;+&#xa0;iε2(ω), and the optical absorption coefficient α(ω) are determined, providing fundamental understanding of these materials. We find that even though the \{PBE\} method generates fairly accurate effective crystal potentials, the \{HSE\} and \{GW\} methods improve considerably the band-gap energies Eg and also the localization of the semicore states, thereby describing the optical properties much better. Furthermore, we also present optimized convergence parameters for the self-consistent \{HSE\} calculation in order to reduce the computational time of this orbital-dependent method. "

abstract = {The performance of organometallic perovskite solar cells has rapidly surpassed that of both conventional dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaics. High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects. The photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current-voltage hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells.},

@article{3rd_gen,
abstract = {Third-generation approaches to photovoltaics (PVs) aim to achieve high-efficiency devices but still use thin-film, second-generation deposition methods. The concept is to do this with only a small increase in areal costs and hence reduce the cost per Watt peak1 (this metric is the most widely used in the PV industry). Also, in common with Si-based, second-generation, thin-film technologies, these will use materials that are both nontoxic and not limited in abundance. Thus, these third-generation technologies will be compatible with large-scale implementation of PVs. The approach differs from first-generation fabrication of high-quality, low-defect, single-crystal PV devices that have high efficiencies approaching the limiting efficiencies for single-bandgap devices but use energy- and time-intensive techniques. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Electron-microscopic observations show that the films are composed of minute microcrystallites inclined towards the general vapour direction. The anomalous photovoltaic effect has been studied as a function of light intensity, wavelength and angle of incidence, as well as gaseous environment. The results obtained show that existing models are unable fully to explain the effect. Parallel measurements of the surface photovoltages associated with cleaved single-crystal CdTe lead to a new interpretation in terms of surface photovoltages in small inclined crystallites.}

abstract = {The article is devoted to the discussion of the high-throughput approach to band structures calculations. We present scientific and computational challenges as well as solutions relying on the developed framework (Automatic Flow, AFLOW/ACONVASP). The key factors of the method are the standardization and the robustness of the procedures. Two scenarios are relevant: 1) independent users generating databases in their own computational systems (off-line approach) and 2) teamed users sharing computational information based on a common ground (on-line approach). Both cases are integrated in the framework: for off-line approaches, the standardization is automatic and fully integrated for the 14 Bravais lattices, the primitive and conventional unit cells, and the coordinates of the high symmetry k-path in the Brillouin zones. For on-line tasks, the framework offers an expandable web interface where the user can prepare and set up calculations following the proposed standard. Few examples of band structures are included. LSDA+U parameters (U, J) are also presented for Nd, Sm, and Eu.},

Recent rapid proliferation of computational data on materials properties presents the possibility to complement and extend the databases where the experimental data is lacking or difficult to obtain. Enhanced repositories that integrate both computational and empirical approaches open novel opportunities for structure discovery and optimization, including uncovering of unsuspected compounds, metastable structures and correlations between various characteristics. The practical realization of these opportunities depends on a systematic compilation and classification of the generated data in addition to an accessible interface for the materials science community. In this paper we present an extensive repository, aflowlib.org, comprising phase-diagrams, electronic structure and magnetic properties, generated by the high-throughput framework AFLOW. This continuously updated compilation currently contains over 150,000 thermodynamic entries for alloys, covering the entire composition range of more than 650 binary systems, 13,000 electronic structure analyses of inorganic compounds, and 50,000 entries for novel potential magnetic and spintronics systems.

@article{PGE,
abstract = {This review presents the fundamental theoretical concepts concerning the photogalvanic effect (PGE)-the phenomenon of appearance of a direct current in a homogeneous medium under uniform illumination. This effect can occur in all media lacking a center of symmetry, in particular, in ferroelectrics, piezoelectrics, gyrotropic crystals, and in gases and liquid possessing natural optical activity. The starting point of a systematic microscopic theory is the asymmetry of the elementary electronic processes-their noninvariance with respect to spatial reflection. Within the framework of the theory, the authors study the most important mechanisms of the PGE in the regions of impurity, interband, and intraband light absorption.

@article{Rappe,
abstract = {We calculate the bulk photovoltaic response of the ferroelectrics BaTiO3 and PbTiO3 from first principles by applying the “shift current” theory to the electronic structure from density functional theory. The first principles results for BaTiO3 reproduce experimental photocurrent direction and magnitude as a function of light frequency, as well as the dependence of current on light polarization, demonstrating that shift current is the dominant mechanism of the bulk photovoltaic effect in BaTiO3. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between response and material properties in detail. Photocurrent does not depend simply or strongly on the magnitude of material polarization, as has been previously assumed; instead, electronic states with delocalized, covalent bonding that is highly asymmetric along the current direction are required for strong shift current enhancements. The complexity of the response dependence on both external and material parameters suggests applications not only in solar energy conversion, but in photocatalysis and sensor and switch type devices as well.},

(Pb, La)(Zr, Ti) \{O3\} (PLZT) ceramics doped with \{WO3\} exhibit large photostriction under uniform illumination of near-ultraviolet light. Using a bimorph configuration, a photo-driven relay and a micro walking device have been demonstrated. However, for the fabrication of these devices, materials exhibiting higher photovoltaic effect and higher response speed must be developed. The present paper reviews a new theoretical model for photovoltaic effect first, then enhanced performance photostrictive materials through sample surface characteristics, finally its potential future applications.

@article{domain_wall,
abstract = {Recently, the anomalous photovoltaic (PV) effect in BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films, which resulted in open circuit voltages (Voc) considerably larger than the band gap of the material, has generated a revival of the entire field of photoferroelectrics. Here, via temperature-dependent PV studies, we prove that the bulk photovoltaic (BPV) effect, which has been studied in the past for many non-centrosymmetric materials, is at the origin of the anomalous PV effect in BFO films. Moreover, we show that irrespective of the measurement geometry, Voc as high as 50 V can be achieved by controlling the conductivity of domain walls (DW). We also show that photoconductivity of the DW is markedly higher than in the bulk of BFO.},

  abstract={We develop a theory of laser beam generation of shift currents in non-centrosymmetric semiconductors. The currents originate when the excited electrons transfer between different bands or scatter inside these bands, and asymmetrically shift their centres of mass in elementary cells. Quantum kinetic equations for hot-carrier distributions and expressions for the induced currents are derived using non-equilibrium Green functions. In applications, we simplify the approach to the Boltzmann limit and use it to model laser-excited GaAs in the presence of longitudinal optical phonon scattering. The shift currents are calculated in a steady-state regime.}

abstract = {The frequency dependent conductivity and permittivity of a ceramic composite are modelled using electrical networks consisting of randomly positioned resistors and capacitors. The electrical network represents a heterogeneous microstructure that contains both insulating (the capacitor) and conductive regions (the resistor). To validate model results, a model ceramic conductor-insulator composite was designed consisting of a porous lead zirconate titanate impregnated with different concentrations of water. Excellent agreement between experimental and model data was achieved with a strong correlation with many other ceramics, glasses and composites. It is proposed that the 'universal' dielectric response of many materials is a consequence of microstructural heterogeneity. The modelling approach could be used as a simple and effective method for microstructural design of ceramics and other materials with tailored dielectric properties.},

abstract = {Hybrid density functionals are very successful in describing a wide range of molecular properties accurately. In large molecules and solids, however, calculating the exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange is computationally expensive, especially for systems with metallic characteristics. In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree-Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.
