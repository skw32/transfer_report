Particular attention is given to the behaviour of the density of states (spectral density) of both the levels derived from those of the perfect crystal and the impurity levels. The effects of ordering of imperfections is considered, and some discussion of other approximations and models is given.},

@article{band_gap_broadening,
abstract = {This work investigates the influence of lateral fluctuations of the fundamental band gap on the macroscopic light absorptance and emission spectra of spatially inhomogeneous semiconductors. A model assuming a Gaussian distribution for the local band gaps yields closed-form expressions for the spectral absorptance and emission. Band gap fluctuations broaden the absorption edge of the fundamental band gap, as well as the associated emission peak. The spectral position of the photoluminescence emission peak depends on the length scale of the fluctuations in relation to the characteristic charge carrier transport length. We apply the model to experimental results from Cu(In1−x,Gax)Se2 thin films routinely used as photovoltaic absorbers in thin-film ZnO/CdS/Cu(In,Ga)Se2 heterojunction solar cells. The films feature band gap fluctuations with standard deviations between 15 and 65 meV which would lead to losses in the range of 5–80 mV for the open circuit voltage of solar cells made from these films. The pure ternary compounds CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2 exhibit smaller standard deviations than their quaternary alloys. This experimental finding indicates alloy disorder as one possible source of band gap inhomogeneities. The length scale of the observed fluctuations turns out to be much smaller than the minority carrier diffusion length. Hence, the band gap fluctuations occur on a length scale below 100 nm.},

@article{defects_Lany,
abstract = {The theoretical description of defects and impurities in semiconductors is largely based on density functional theory (DFT) employing supercell models. The literature discussion of uncertainties that limit the predictivity of this approach has focused mostly on two issues: (1) finite-size effects, in particular for charged defects; (2) the band-gap problem in local or semi-local DFT approximations. We here describe how finite-size effects (1) in the formation energy of charged defects can be accurately corrected in a simple way, i.e. by potential alignment in conjunction with a scaling of the Madelung-like screened first order correction term. The factor involved with this scaling depends only on the dielectric constant and the shape of the supercell, and quite accurately accounts for the full third order correction according to Makov and Payne. We further discuss in some detail the background and justification for this correction method, and also address the effect of the ionic screening on the magnitude of the image charge energy. In regard to (2) the band-gap problem, we discuss the merits of non-local external potentials that are added to the DFT Hamiltonian and allow for an empirical band-gap correction without significantly increasing the computational demand over that of standard DFT calculations. In combination with LDA + U, these potentials are further instrumental for the prediction of polaronic defects with localized holes in anion-p orbitals, such as the metal-site acceptors in wide-gap oxide semiconductors.},

abstract = {Ferroelectric oxides, which exhibit a spontaneous and reversible electric polarization, have recently gained interest for photovoltaic applications because this polarization can potentially facilitate exciton separation and carrier extraction while also generating open-circuit voltages orders-of-magnitude larger than the band gap. However, photovoltaic efficiencies in these materials are often limited by large band gaps and high hole effective masses. Developing a means to simultaneously reduce both without destroying the ferroelectric polarization could revolutionize photovoltaic technologies. In this work, we use first-principles computations to describe how chemical substitution of oxygen in the recently characterized ferroelectric ZnSnO3 with sulfur to form ZnSnS3 reduces the band gap to a near-optimal 1.3 eV while leaving the polarization virtually unchanged. Further, we show that other key photovoltaic materials characteristics, such as hole effective mass, dielectric constant, and absorption coefficient, are also dramatically improved by sulfur substitution. Finally, we demonstrate that the well-known semiconductor GaN provides an excellent substrate on which to grow ZnSnS3, forming a strongly bound interface that is free of intrinsic mid-gap states and exhibits an ideal band alignment for efficient carrier extraction. This work advances the search for an earth-abundant, nontoxic, ferroelectric material exhibiting strong solar absorption, and may enable the development of solar cells with both high photovoltage and photocurrent.$\backslash$nFerroelectric oxides, which exhibit a spontaneous and reversible electric polarization, have recently gained interest for photovoltaic applications because this polarization can potentially facilitate exciton separation and carrier extraction while also generating open-circuit voltages orders-of-magnitude larger than the band gap.

abstract = {Materials science is a highly interdisciplinary field. It is devoted to the understanding of the relationship between (a) fundamental physical and chemical properties governing processes at the atomistic scale with (b) typically macroscopic properties required of materials in engineering applications. For many materials, this relationship is not only determined by chemical composition, but strongly governed by microstructure. The latter is a consequence of carefully selected process conditions (e.g., mechanical forming and annealing in metallurgy or epitaxial growth in semiconductor technology). A key task of computational materials science is to unravel the often hidden composition-structure-property relationships using computational techniques. The present paper does not aim to give a complete review of all aspects of materials science. Rather, we will present the key concepts underlying the computation of selected material properties and discuss the major classes of materials to which they are applied. Specifically, our focus will be on methods used to describe single or polycrystalline bulk materials of semiconductor, metal or ceramic form.},

abstract = {Ferroelectrics carry a switchable spontaneous electric polarization. This polarization is usually coupled to strain, making ferroelectrics good piezoelectrics. When coupled to magnetism, they become so-called multiferroic systems, a field that has been widely investigated since 2003. While ferroelectrics are birefringent and non-linear optically transparent materials, the coupling of polarization with optical properties has received, since 2009, renewed attention, triggered notably by low-bandgap ferroelectrics suitable for sunlight spectrum absorption and original photovoltaic effects. Consequently, power conversion efficiencies up to 8.1{\%} were recently achieved and values of 19.5{\%} were predicted, making photoferroelectrics promising photovoltaic alternatives. This article aims at providing an up-to-date review on this emerging and rapidly progressing field by highlighting several important issues and parameters, such as the role of domain walls, ways to tune the bandgap, consequences arising from the polarization switchability, and the role of defects and contact electrodes, as well as the downscaling effects. Beyond photovoltaicity, other polarization-related processes are also described, like light-induced deformation (photostriction) or light-assisted chemical reaction (photostriction). It is hoped that this overview will encourage further avenues to be explored and challenged and, as a byproduct, will inspire other research communities in material science, e.g., so-called hybrid halide perovskites.},

The recent reduction in the cost of 2nd generation thin-film \{PV\} is remarkable, meeting the production milestone of $1 per watt in the fourth quarter of 2008. This achievement holds great promise for the future. However, the questions remaining are whether the expense of \{PV\} modules can be lowered further, and if there are resource- and environmental-impact constraints to growth. I examine the potential of thin-films in a prospective life-cycle analysis, focusing on direct costs, resource availability, and environmental impacts. These three aspects are closely related; developing thinner solar cells and recycling spent modules will become increasingly important in resolving cost, resource, and environmental constraints to large scales of sustainable growth.

@article{Adam_sulfur,
abstract = {The unusual chemistry of sulfur is illustrated by the tendency for catenation. Sulfur forms a range of open and closed Sn species in the gas phase, which has led to speculation on the composition of sulfur vapours as a function of temperature and pressure for over a century. Unlike elemental gases such as O2 and N2, there is no widely accepted thermodynamic potential for sulfur. Here we combine a first-principles global structure search for the low energy clusters from S2 to S8 with a thermodynamic model for the mixed-allotrope system, including the Gibbs free energy for all gas-phase sulfur on an atomic basis. A strongly pressure-dependent transition from a mixture dominant in S2 to S8 is identified. A universal chemical potential function, $\mu$S(T,P), is proposed with wide utility in modelling sulfurisation processes including the formation and annealing of metal chalcogenide semiconductors.},

@article{CZTS_n-type,
abstract = {An extremely environment-friendly aqueous-ink process for Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) fabrication is reported. The aqueous ink is composed of SnSX nanoparticles, zinc ions from zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2), and metal complex made of copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2) and thioacetamide (C2H5NS). The combinations of negatively surface-charged SnSX nanoparticles and cations form electric double layers and lead to a well-mixed and dispersed aqueous CZTSSe precursor ink, which eliminates the usage of hazard solvent. The results of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, and auger electron spectroscopy show that the CZTSSe film possesses a single phase, good crystallinity, and uniform composition after an annealing process. A high cell efficiency of 10.05{\%} is achieved by using this novel aqueous-ink approach. To further investigate the possible root cause of efficiency limitation, the electrical properties of CZTSSe cells are studied. The existence of deep donor defects, which results in low carrier concentration as well as collapsed short-circuit current and fill factor at low temperature, is proposed. Our proposed model suggests that the relatively deep p-type defects (CuZn) as the major carrier source, the existence of deep n-type defects and short diffusion length are the key limitations for achieving high efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells.},

@article{kosyak,
abstract = {We report a quasichemical model for point defect equilibrium in Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS). An ab initio calculation was used to estimate the changes in the phonon spectrum of CZTS due to trial point defects and further vibrational free energy, which in turn influences the final defect concentrations. We identify the dominant point defects and estimate the free carrier concentrations as functions of the Zn, Cu, and Sn chemical potentials, the sulfur chemical potential being set by the vapor-solid equilibrium with elemental S at the same temperature as the sample (one-zone annealing). As hinted by calculated low formation enthalpies, either the Cu vacancy (V? Cu) or Cu on Zn antisite (Cu? Zn) acceptors are expected to dominate over a wide range of cation chemical potentials. However, the sulfur vacancy (V2þS ) becomes a dominant compensating donor especially for one-zone annealing conditions. We also find that different native defects induce distinct perturbations to the vibrational free energy, resulting in non-trivial qualitative and quantitative shifts in the defect equilibrium. At typical annealing temperatures and Zn-rich conditions, this may introduce especially strong modulations in the concentrations of Zn2? Sn and, contrary to enthalpic predictions, of Znþ Cu compensating donors. The modeling indicates that one-zone processing should result in CZTS, which is p-type but extremely compensated because native donor defects are stabilized by the low Fermi level and finite-temperature effects.},

abstract = {Kesterite materials (Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4) are made from non-toxic, earth-abundant and low-cost raw materials. We summarise here the structural and electronic material data relevant for the solar cells. The equilibrium structure of both Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 is the kesterite structure. However, the stannite structure has only a slightly lower binding energy. Because the band gap of the stannite is predicted to be about 100?meV lower than the kesterite band gap, any admixture of stannite will hurt the solar cells. The band gaps of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 are 1.5 and 1.0?eV, respectively. Hardly any experiments on defects are available. Theoretically, the CuZn antisite acceptor is predicted as the most probable defect. The existence region of the kesterite phase is smaller compared with that of chalcopyrites. This makes secondary phases a serious challenge in the development of solar cells. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

While cadmium telluride and copper{\textendash}indium{\textendash}gallium{\textendash}sulfide{\textendash}selenide (CIGSSe) solar cells have either already surpassed (for CdTe) or reached (for CIGSSe) the 1 GW yr-1 production level, highlighting the promise of these rapidly growing thin-film technologies, reliance on the heavy metal cadmium and scarce elements indium and tellurium has prompted concern about scalability towards the terawatt level. Despite recent advances in structurally related copper{\textendash}zinc{\textendash}tin{\textendash}sulfide{\textendash}selenide (CZTSSe) absorbers, in which indium from CIGSSe is replaced with more plentiful and lower cost zinc and tin, there is still a sizeable performance gap between the kesterite CZTSSe and the more mature CdTe and CIGSSe technologies. This review will discuss recent progress in the CZTSSe field, especially focusing on a direct comparison with analogous higher performing CIGSSe to probe the performance bottlenecks in Earth-abundant kesterite devices. Key limitations in the current generation of CZTSSe devices include a shortfall in open circuit voltage relative to the absorber band gap and secondarily a high series resistance, which contributes to a lower device fill factor. Understanding and addressing these performance issues should yield closer performance parity between CZTSSe and CdTe/CIGSSe absorbers and hopefully facilitate a successful launch of commercialization for the kesterite-based technology.

abstract  ="The need for large scale low carbon solar electricity production has become increasingly urgent for reasons of energy security and climate change mitigation. Third-generation solar cells (SCs) are solution processed SCs based on semiconducting organic macromolecules{,} inorganic nanoparticles or hybrids. This review considers and compares three types of promising 3rd-generation SCs: polymer:fullerene{,} hybrid polymer and perovskite SCs. The review considers work reported since an earlier review (Saunders et al.{,} Adv. Colloid Interface Sci.{,} 2008{,} 138{,} 1) and highlights the great progress that has been made in each area. We consider the operation principles for each SC type and also review the state-of-the-art devices. The polymer:fullerene and hybrid polymer SC open circuit voltages are compared to values predicted from the well-known Scharber equation and similarities and differences discussed. The perovskite SCs are also considered and their remarkable rate of power conversion efficiency performance increase is discussed. The review considers the requirements for large-scale deployment in the contexts of semiconducting polymer and hole transport matrix synthesis and materials selection. It is concluded that the 3rd-generation SC technologies discussed here are well placed for major contribution to large scale energy production. (This has already been partially demonstrated for polymer:fullerene SCs.) Looking further ahead we propose that several of the 3rd-generation SCs considered here have excellent potential to provide the low cost large-scale deployment needed to meet the terawatt challenge for solar electricity generation."}

abstract = "Third-generation approaches to photovoltaics (PVs) aim to achieve high-efficiency devices but still use thin-film, second-generation deposition methods. The concept is to do this with only a small increase in areal costs and hence reduce the cost per Watt peak1 (this metric is the most widely used in the \{PV\} industry). Also, in common with Si-based, second-generation, thin-film technologies, these will use materials that are both nontoxic and not limited in abundance. Thus, these third-generation technologies will be compatible with large-scale implementation of PVs. The approach differs from first-generation fabrication of high-quality, low-defect, single-crystal \{PV\} devices that have high efficiencies approaching the limiting efficiencies for single-bandgap devices but use energy- and time-intensive techniques.

The density-of-states, the complex dielectric function ε(ω)&#xa0;=&#xa0;ε1(ω)&#xa0;+&#xa0;iε2(ω), and the optical absorption coefficient α(ω) are determined, providing fundamental understanding of these materials. We find that even though the \{PBE\} method generates fairly accurate effective crystal potentials, the \{HSE\} and \{GW\} methods improve considerably the band-gap energies Eg and also the localization of the semicore states, thereby describing the optical properties much better. Furthermore, we also present optimized convergence parameters for the self-consistent \{HSE\} calculation in order to reduce the computational time of this orbital-dependent method. "

The Cu/(Zn+Sn) ratio of the thin film sputtered at 75&#xa0;W was close to the stoichiometry of Cu2ZnSnS4. However, the S/(Cu+Zn+Sn) ratio was less than the stoichiometry. The as-deposited films were amorphous and annealed in the atmosphere of Ar+S2 (g).

A preferred (1&#xa0;1&#xa0;2) orientation was observed with the increase of the annealing temperature. The optical absorption coefficient of the thin film was about 1.0×104&#xa0;cm−1. The optical band energy was derived to be 1.51&#xa0;eV. The optical absorption coefficient of the sputtered Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films was less than that of CuInS2 thin film, however, the band gap energy was more appropriate for photovoltaic materials. "

abstract = {TiO2 doped with Cu2+ initiates the formation of brookite phase along with anatase. Doping of Cu2+ introduces structural defects into TiO2. The direct evidence is the low intense and broad diffraction peaks. Raman peaks of doped TiO2 are also broad and are blueshifted. Pure TiO2 exhibits an absorption in the UV region, the position of which is shifted towards the visible region on incorporation of Cu into it. The visible absorption peaks arise due to the d-d transition of Cu2+ in the crystalline environment of TiO2. Incorporation of Cu2+ distorts the local structure of TiO2, resulting in the loss of octahedral symmetry surrounding Cu2+. The Jahn-Teller distortion splits the 2
					E
					g and 2
					T
					2g state of Cu2+ into several d states. Interaction of light excites the electron from ground to several of the excited states and gives the visible absorption peaks in the framework of TiO2. These Cu2+
					d states and oxygen defects create band states, thereby favoring electronic transition to these levels and resulting in lowering of band gap of TiO2. A direct confirmation is the increase in the magnitude of Urbach energy with the reduction in the band gap of doped TiO2.},

abstract = {Point defects and impurities strongly affect the physical properties of materials and have a decisive impact on their performance in applications. First-principles calculations have emerged as a powerful approach that complements experiments and can serve as a predictive tool in the identification and characterization of defects. The theoretical modeling of point defects in crystalline materials by means of electronic-structure calculations, with an emphasis on approaches based on density functional theory (DFT), is reviewed. A general thermodynamic formalism is laid down to investigate the physical properties of point defects independent of the materials class (semiconductors, insulators, and metals), indicating how the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as formation energy, entropy, and excess volume, can be obtained from electronic structure calculations. Practical aspects such as the supercell approach and efficient strategies to extrapolate to the isolated-defect or dilute limit are discussed. Recent advances in tractable approximations to the exchange-correlation functional (DFT þ U, hybrid functionals) and approaches beyond DFT are highlighted. These advances have largely removed the long-standing uncertainty of defect formation energies in semiconductors and insulators due to the failure of standard DFT to reproduce band gaps. Two case studies illustrate how such calculations provide new insight into the physics and role of point defects in real materials.},

@article{defects_new,
abstract = {The quaternary Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is a promising material for the thin-film solar cell applications. However, because CZTS is only stabilized in a very small chemical-potential region and the defect formation is much more complicated compared to the ternary systems, it requires careful control of the thin-film solar cell preparation. We have performed a density-functional theory investigation on the intrinsic defects, defect complexes and Na doping in this complicated system. Our calculations show that the disorder and nonstoichiometry in the Cu–Zn plane induces a bandgap shrinkage of the material. From our calculated results for various defects and the doping rules, we rationalize why the experiments obtain high conversion efficiencies for the thin-film solar cells under the Cu-poor and Zn-rich conditions. The most possible defects which fulfill the experimental Cu-poor and Zn-rich conditions are VCu, rather than ZnCu. It is necessary to keep the Sn chemical potential moderate during the CZTS thin-film solar cell growth because the Sn-involved defects and defect complexes are generally harmful. We also find that Na doping is expected to increase the conductivity and improves the conversion efficiency of CZTS solar cells. The present study provides valuable insights into the defect physics of the complicated CZTS system and a theoretical basis for exploring its practical applications as thin-film solar cell absorbers.},

We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called \{VAMP\} (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package).

In large molecules and solids, however, calculating the exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange is computationally expensive, especially for systems with metallic characteristics. In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree-Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.

Both compounds were found to crystallize in the kesterite type structure, but with a disorder within the Cu–Zn layers at z=1/4 and 3/4. The latter causes CuZn and ZnCu anti-site defects, whose concentration depends on the sample growth conditions. The temperature dependent structural phase transition in \{CZTS\} was studied by in-situ high temperature diffraction experiments using high energy synchrotron X-rays. The transition from the tetragonal kesterite to the cubic sphalerite type structure is discussed by means of the interplay of increasing and decreasing cation–anion–cation bond angles in the coordination tetrahedra, reflected by the shift of the anion atomic coordinates to more ideal (x and y) or non-ideal (z) values. This striking behavior may be connected with frustrations that occur due to the triangular geometry of the coordination tetrahedra. "

abstract = "Understanding the impact on the electronic and optical properties of kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 due to the presence of native defects is crucial for designing and manufacturing efficient solar cells. In this work, we complement earlier published theoretical studies by investigating the change in the Cu2ZnSnS4 band gap energy induced by the dominating isovalent (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;CuZn) and (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;VCu) defect complexes and the corresponding larger [(ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;CuZn)&#xa0;+&#xa0;(ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;VCu)] complex. The study is based on the generalized gradient approximation with corrections for on-site Coulomb interactions (GGA&#xa0;+&#xa0;U) and the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerh hybrid functional method (HSE06) within the first-principles density functional theory. We find that (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;CuZn) and (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;VCu) affect the band gap energies in an opposite way: (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;CuZn) decreases the gap whereas (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;VCu) increases the gap. However, there is a strong correlation between these two defect complexes. The presence of the Cu-poor (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;VCu) defect complex lowers the formation energy of the antisite (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;CuZn) defect complex in close configuration, and vice versa. Thereby, and considering the opposite effect on the band gap for (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;CuZn) and (ZnCu&#xa0;+&#xa0;VCu), our results indicate that the band gap energy will be compensated and stabilized in Cu-poor Cu2ZnSnS4. We discuss the underlying mechanisms behind the band gap physics of the considered isovalent defect complexes. "

We show that samples deficient in zinc show on average a higher quasi donor-acceptor pair (QDAP) density. However, the QDAP density in samples with the same metal composition also varies widely. Devices prepared with similar metal compositions show different open-circuit voltages and fill factors. These metrics are correlated with the concentration of QDAPs in the absorbers. One additional device with insufficient zinc showed the empirically observed low-efficiency expected for this composition. This sample also showed the highest quasi donor-acceptor pair density of all the devices measured.},

abstract = {The growth of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) polycrystals from solid state reaction over a range of compositions, including the regions which produce the highest efficiency photovoltaic devices, is reported. X-ray measurements confirm the growth of crystalline CZTS. Temperature and intensity dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements show an increase in the energy of the main CZTS luminescence peak with both increasing laser power and increasing temperature. Analysis of the PL peak positions and intensity behavior demonstrates that the results are consistent with the model of fluctuating potentials. This confirms that the polycrystals are heavily doped with the presence of a large concentration of intrinsic defects. The behavior of the main luminescence feature is shown to be qualitatively similar over a broad range of compositions although the nature and amount of secondary phases vary significantly. The implications for thin-film photovoltaic devices are discussed},

So far very little effort has been put into understanding the basic material properties. We investigate vapour phase grown Cu2SnZnS4 crystals by temperature and intensity dependent photoluminescence measurements. We observe for the first time narrow photoluminescence peaks, which allow us to determine defect levels and to propose a defect recombination model for Cu2SnZnS4. Assuming an exciton binding energy of 10 meV, we find an energy gap of 1.519 eV at 10 K. From the observed DA transitions we derive the energies of two shallow acceptor states 10±5 and 30±5 meV above the valence band and one shallow donor state 5±3 meV below the conduction band. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{FE_PV_rev1,
abstract = {The ferroelectric-photovoltaic (FE-PV) device, in which a homogeneous ferroelectric material is used as a light absorbing layer, has been investigated during the past several decades with numerous ferroelectric oxides. The FE-PV effect is distinctly different from the typical photovoltaic (PV) effect in semiconductor p–n junctions in that the polarization electric field is the driving force for the photocurrent in FE-PV devices. In addition, the anomalous photovoltaic effect, in which the voltage output along the polarization direction can be significantly larger than the bandgap of the ferroelectric materials, has been frequently observed in FE-PV devices. However, a big challenge faced by the FE-PV devices is the very low photocurrent output. The research interest in FE-PV devices has been re-spurred by the recent discovery of above-bandgap photovoltage in materials with ferroelectric domain walls, electric switchable diodes and photovoltaic effects, tip-enhanced photovoltaic effects at the nanoscale, and new low-bandgap ferroelectric materials and device design. In this feature article, we reviewed the advance in understanding the mechanisms of the ferroelectric photovoltaic effects and recent progress in improving the photovoltaic device performance, including the emerging approaches of integrating the ferroelectric materials into organic heterojunction photovoltaic devices for very high efficiency PV devices.},

We summarise here the structural and electronic material data relevant for the solar cells. The equilibrium structure of both Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 is the kesterite structure. However, the stannite structure has only a slightly lower binding energy. Because the band gap of the stannite is predicted to be about 100?meV lower than the kesterite band gap, any admixture of stannite will hurt the solar cells. The band gaps of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 are 1.5 and 1.0?eV, respectively. Hardly any experiments on defects are available. Theoretically, the CuZn antisite acceptor is predicted as the most probable defect. The existence region of the kesterite phase is smaller compared with that of chalcopyrites. This makes secondary phases a serious challenge in the development of solar cells. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The performance of organometallic perovskite solar cells has rapidly surpassed that of both conventional dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaics. High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects. The photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current-voltage hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells.},

abstract = {Third-generation approaches to photovoltaics (PVs) aim to achieve high-efficiency devices but still use thin-film, second-generation deposition methods. The concept is to do this with only a small increase in areal costs and hence reduce the cost per Watt peak1 (this metric is the most widely used in the PV industry). Also, in common with Si-based, second-generation, thin-film technologies, these will use materials that are both nontoxic and not limited in abundance. Thus, these third-generation technologies will be compatible with large-scale implementation of PVs. The approach differs from first-generation fabrication of high-quality, low-defect, single-crystal PV devices that have high efficiencies approaching the limiting efficiencies for single-bandgap devices but use energy- and time-intensive techniques. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract={The anomalous photovoltaic effect has been investigated in thin films of CdTe deposited by evaporation onto inclined insulating substrates. Electron-microscopic observations show that the films are composed of minute microcrystallites inclined towards the general vapour direction. The anomalous photovoltaic effect has been studied as a function of light intensity, wavelength and angle of incidence, as well as gaseous environment. The results obtained show that existing models are unable fully to explain the effect. Parallel measurements of the surface photovoltages associated with cleaved single-crystal CdTe lead to a new interpretation in terms of surface photovoltages in small inclined crystallites.}

@article{high_tp2,
abstract = {The article is devoted to the discussion of the high-throughput approach to band structures calculations. We present scientific and computational challenges as well as solutions relying on the developed framework (Automatic Flow, AFLOW/ACONVASP). The key factors of the method are the standardization and the robustness of the procedures. Two scenarios are relevant: 1) independent users generating databases in their own computational systems (off-line approach) and 2) teamed users sharing computational information based on a common ground (on-line approach). Both cases are integrated in the framework: for off-line approaches, the standardization is automatic and fully integrated for the 14 Bravais lattices, the primitive and conventional unit cells, and the coordinates of the high symmetry k-path in the Brillouin zones. For on-line tasks, the framework offers an expandable web interface where the user can prepare and set up calculations following the proposed standard. Few examples of band structures are included. LSDA+U parameters (U, J) are also presented for Nd, Sm, and Eu.},

Recent rapid proliferation of computational data on materials properties presents the possibility to complement and extend the databases where the experimental data is lacking or difficult to obtain. Enhanced repositories that integrate both computational and empirical approaches open novel opportunities for structure discovery and optimization, including uncovering of unsuspected compounds, metastable structures and correlations between various characteristics. The practical realization of these opportunities depends on a systematic compilation and classification of the generated data in addition to an accessible interface for the materials science community. In this paper we present an extensive repository, aflowlib.org, comprising phase-diagrams, electronic structure and magnetic properties, generated by the high-throughput framework AFLOW. This continuously updated compilation currently contains over 150,000 thermodynamic entries for alloys, covering the entire composition range of more than 650 binary systems, 13,000 electronic structure analyses of inorganic compounds, and 50,000 entries for novel potential magnetic and spintronics systems. The repository is available for the scientific community on the website of the materials research consortium, aflowlib.org. "

In this article, we describe aspects of the necessary data infrastructure for such projects to handle data generation and data analysis in a scalable way. We discuss the problem of accurately computing properties of compounds across diverse chemical spaces with a single exchange correlation functional, and demonstrate that errors in the generalized gradient approximation are highly dependent on chemical environment.

@article{PGE,
abstract = {This review presents the fundamental theoretical concepts concerning the photogalvanic effect (PGE)-the phenomenon of appearance of a direct current in a homogeneous medium under uniform illumination. This effect can occur in all media lacking a center of symmetry, in particular, in ferroelectrics, piezoelectrics, gyrotropic crystals, and in gases and liquid possessing natural optical activity. The starting point of a systematic microscopic theory is the asymmetry of the elementary electronic processes-their noninvariance with respect to spatial reflection. Within the framework of the theory, the authors study the most important mechanisms of the PGE in the regions of impurity, interband, and intraband light absorption. Possible observable manifestations of the PGE are discussed. Theoretical results are compared with experimental data. (105 References).},

@article{Rappe,
abstract = {We calculate the bulk photovoltaic response of the ferroelectrics BaTiO3 and PbTiO3 from first principles by applying the “shift current” theory to the electronic structure from density functional theory. The first principles results for BaTiO3 reproduce experimental photocurrent direction and magnitude as a function of light frequency, as well as the dependence of current on light polarization, demonstrating that shift current is the dominant mechanism of the bulk photovoltaic effect in BaTiO3. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between response and material properties in detail. Photocurrent does not depend simply or strongly on the magnitude of material polarization, as has been previously assumed; instead, electronic states with delocalized, covalent bonding that is highly asymmetric along the current direction are required for strong shift current enhancements. The complexity of the response dependence on both external and material parameters suggests applications not only in solar energy conversion, but in photocatalysis and sensor and switch type devices as well.},

abstract = {Recently, the anomalous photovoltaic (PV) effect in BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films, which resulted in open circuit voltages (Voc) considerably larger than the band gap of the material, has generated a revival of the entire field of photoferroelectrics. Here, via temperature-dependent PV studies, we prove that the bulk photovoltaic (BPV) effect, which has been studied in the past for many non-centrosymmetric materials, is at the origin of the anomalous PV effect in BFO films. Moreover, we show that irrespective of the measurement geometry, Voc as high as 50 V can be achieved by controlling the conductivity of domain walls (DW). We also show that photoconductivity of the DW is markedly higher than in the bulk of BFO.},

  abstract={We develop a theory of laser beam generation of shift currents in non-centrosymmetric semiconductors. The currents originate when the excited electrons transfer between different bands or scatter inside these bands, and asymmetrically shift their centres of mass in elementary cells. Quantum kinetic equations for hot-carrier distributions and expressions for the induced currents are derived using non-equilibrium Green functions. In applications, we simplify the approach to the Boltzmann limit and use it to model laser-excited GaAs in the presence of longitudinal optical phonon scattering. The shift currents are calculated in a steady-state regime.}

abstract = {The frequency dependent conductivity and permittivity of a ceramic composite are modelled using electrical networks consisting of randomly positioned resistors and capacitors. The electrical network represents a heterogeneous microstructure that contains both insulating (the capacitor) and conductive regions (the resistor). To validate model results, a model ceramic conductor-insulator composite was designed consisting of a porous lead zirconate titanate impregnated with different concentrations of water. Excellent agreement between experimental and model data was achieved with a strong correlation with many other ceramics, glasses and composites. It is proposed that the 'universal' dielectric response of many materials is a consequence of microstructural heterogeneity. The modelling approach could be used as a simple and effective method for microstructural design of ceramics and other materials with tailored dielectric properties.},

  abstract={The efficient implementation of electronic structure methods is essential for first principles modeling of molecules and solids. We present here a particularly efficient common framework for methods beyond semilocal density-functional theory (DFT), including HartreeâFock (HF), hybrid density functionals, random-phase approximation (RPA), second-order MÃžllerâPlesset perturbation theory (MP2) and the GW method. This computational framework allows us to use compact and accurate numeric atom-centered orbitals (NAOs), popular in many implementations of semilocal DFT, as basis functions. The essence of our framework is to employ the âresolution of identity (RI)â technique to facilitate the treatment of both the two-electron Coulomb repulsion integrals (required in all these approaches) and the linear density-response function (required for RPA and GW ). This is possible because these quantities can be expressed in terms of the products of single-particle basis functions, which can in turn be expanded in a set of auxiliary basis functions (ABFs). The construction of ABFs lies at the heart of the RI technique, and we propose here a simple prescription for constructing ABFs which can be applied regardless of whether the underlying radial functions have a specific analytical shape (e.g. Gaussian) or are numerically tabulated. We demonstrate the accuracy of our RI implementation for Gaussian and NAO basis functions, as well as the convergence behavior of our NAO basis sets for the above-mentioned methods. Benchmark results are presented for the ionization energies of 50 selected atoms and molecules from the G2 ion test set obtained with the GW and MP2 self-energy methods, and the G2-I atomization energies as well as the S22 molecular interaction energies obtained with the RPA method.}

We outline the overall formulation of localized algorithms, and specifically the creation of localized grid batches. The choice of the grid partitioning scheme plays an important role in the performance and memory consumption of the grid-based operations. Three different top-down partitioning methods are investigated, and compared with formally more rigorous yet much more expensive bottom-up algorithms. We show that a conceptually simple top-down grid partitioning scheme achieves essentially the same efficiency as the more rigorous bottom-up approaches. "

abstract = {Hybrid density functionals are very successful in describing a wide range of molecular properties accurately. In large molecules and solids, however, calculating the exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange is computationally expensive, especially for systems with metallic characteristics. In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree-Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.

Differences in longitudinal and transverse optical (LO-TO) splitting in kesterite, stannite, and PMCA structures can be used to differentiate them. The $\Gamma$-point phonon frequencies, which give rise to Raman scattering, exhibit small but measurable shifts, for these three structures. Experimentally measured Raman scattering from CZTS and CZTSe thin films were examined in light of DFT calculations and deconvoluted to explain subtle shifts and asymmetric line shapes often observed in CZTS and CZTSe Raman spectra. Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with ab initio calculations can be used to differentiate between kesterite, stannite, and PMCA structures of CZTS and CZTSe. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics},

The spin-orbit interaction is taken into account as a perturbation to the scalar relativistic Hamiltonian. These are the first calculations of conduction band spin splittings based on a quasiparticle approach; and because the self-consistent GW scheme accurately reproduces the relevant band parameters, it is expected to be a reliable predictor of spin splittings. The results are compared to the few available experimental data and a previous calculation based on a model one-particle potential. We also briefly address the widely used k x p parametrization in the context of these results.},

Large internal electric fields act on spin-orbit-coupled band extrema, shifting band-edges to inequivalent wavevectors, making the fundamental gap indirect. From a description of photoluminescence within the quasiparticle self-consistent GW approximation for MAPI, CdTe, and GaAs, we predict carrier lifetime as a function of light intensity and temperature. At operating conditions we find radiative recombination in MAPI is reduced by a factor of more than 350 compared to direct gap behavior. The indirect gap is retained with dynamic disorder.},

FUTURE WORK

@article{Adam_sulfur,
abstract = {The unusual chemistry of sulfur is illustrated by the tendency for catenation. Sulfur forms a range of open and closed Sn species in the gas phase, which has led to speculation on the composition of sulfur vapours as a function of temperature and pressure for over a century. Unlike elemental gases such as O2 and N2, there is no widely accepted thermodynamic potential for sulfur. Here we combine a first-principles global structure search for the low energy clusters from S2 to S8 with a thermodynamic model for the mixed-allotrope system, including the Gibbs free energy for all gas-phase sulfur on an atomic basis. A strongly pressure-dependent transition from a mixture dominant in S2 to S8 is identified. A universal chemical potential function, $\mu$S(T,P), is proposed with wide utility in modelling sulfurisation processes including the formation and annealing of metal chalcogenide semiconductors.},
