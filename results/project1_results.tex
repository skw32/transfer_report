\section{Formation Energy of Sulfur Vacancies}
We investigate the formation energy of charge neutral sulfur vacancies (V$_{S}^{0}$) as a function of the sulfur chemical potential, which itself is a function of temperature and pressure. We therefore can assess the formation energy of the vacancy under typical annealing conditions. Work from Scragg et al showed that annealing out Cu and Zn disorder can be a very time consuming process, therefore for most practical purposes some disorder will be `frozen in' after annealing. Typical annealing conditions for { \CZTS } are at ?? K and it has been shown that lower pressures are more optimal for the sulfide (whereas higher pressures are better for the selenide) **cite Adam?**. This is due to the allotropes of S?\\

On -going calculations are being performed for the charged sulfur vacancies (V$_{S}^{+1}$ and V$_{S}^{+2}$) so that the minimum energy defect, accounting for all possible charge states, across the temperature and pressure range can be determined.

\section{Intrinsic Band Gap Broadening from Lattice Vibrations}
For CZTS we find that the band gap decreases with temperature as a result of lattice dilation, which a trend observed in most typical semiconductors such as Si, Ge and GaAs. *see slide show results* -- discuss deformation potential, elastic constant and band gap broadening as a function of T (fundamental intrinsic limit to charge-carrier mobilities) + discuss than we calculate just one contribution to the broadening currently to compare to expt to determine how much is intrinsic and how much is defect-related. Although we calculate only gamm-acoustic as opposed to LO? see MAPI paper eqn1
