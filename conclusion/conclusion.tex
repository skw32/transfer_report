\section{Future Work}

Future Work.
\begin{itemize}
\item GBs in CZTS: Comparison to David's HRTEM images? Keith's code for lattice strain/ plausibility of interfaces, workfunction calculations
\item methodology development with eris - algorithm development to simulate larger systems (e.g. parallelization by domain decomposition)
\item Simulations to determine most likely surface terminations to inform exptl strategies for surface passivation?
\end{itemize}
