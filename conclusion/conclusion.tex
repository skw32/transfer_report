\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item Simulations to determine most likely surface terminations to inform exptl strategies for surface passivation?
\item Further work on S vacancies?
\item More properties of sulfosalt materials + calculations to predict FE?
\item Further investigations with eris? Cu-poor CZTS?
\item Extend eris Hamiltonian to next nearest neighbour interactions (likely to be important for long ranged coulomb interactions)
\item Simulate larger systems with eris - domain formation and band gap fluctuations?
\end{itemize}
