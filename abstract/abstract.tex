\begin{itemize}
\item Why metal sulfides - some have ideal optical properties and some are earth abundant? (look for book on sulfide minerals)
\item \CZTS as a promising earth-abundant non-toxic solar absorber material for thin-film photovoltaic devices, theoretical conversion efficiency of 28\% but major bottleneck of low open circuit voltage (V$_{OC}$) relative to the band gap of the material.
\item CZTS bottlenecks we address in this study
\item Candidate photoferroelectric materials from screening process and properties for PV that we predict + novel properties of FE (Rashba splitting and FE domains for reduced recombination)
\end{itemize}
