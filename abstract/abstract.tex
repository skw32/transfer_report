\begin{abstract}

CZTS as a promising earth-abundant non-toxic solar absorber material for thin-film photovoltaic devices, theoretical conversion efficiency of 28 \% but major bottleneck of low open circuit voltage (V$_{OC}$) relative to the band gap of the material. Highlight importance of interpreting PL spectra for PV materials?\\
Candidate photoferroelectric materials from screening process and properties for PV that we predict.\\

Address why metal sulphides?
