\begin{abstract}

Clarify link between 'solar cell' and PV device here?\\
CZTS as a promising earth-abundant non-toxic solar absorber material for thin-film photovoltaic devices, theoretical conversion efficiency of 28 \% but major bottleneck of low open circuit voltage (V$_{OC}$) relative to the band gap of the material. Highlight importance of interpreting PL spectra for PV materials?\\
Candidate photoferroelectric materials from screening process and properties for PV that we predict.
